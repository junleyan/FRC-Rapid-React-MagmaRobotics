the nomenclature of all of the commands is messed up
1. they do not match the actual name of our parts/structures, hence the comments on the top of those files
2. there is some confusion on toggle/off/stop as well, as some things used a limit switch before, and was not updated

also...
auto dump does not work   :D
it continues somehow after putting a wait command?

generally i just feel bad for you if you have to read this code lol

basically
----
subsystems are the tunnel to sending power to motors
commands simplify directly changing sent motor power and instead turn certian actions into commands
and these commands are called in robotcontainer depending on the button press
auto is also controlled in robotcontainer
